Ready script to execute and complete tasks of DigitalOcean hacktoberfest  :D https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com

## Instructions 
* Clone this repository
* Install package `jq` using the command `sudo apt-get install jq` (Ubuntu)
* Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens and generate a token. Tick `repo` and `user` when asked. 
* Execute `script.sh` as follows 

```bash
./script.sh YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```
Done :)

## Info

Please don't file issues about the script being broken because it doesn't handle `argc` and `argv`. Try to understand that this is just a makeshift script (You want a shirt or not ?) and any pull request is welcome.
